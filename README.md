**Will's Linux From Scratch**

WLFS is a linux distribution built entirely from source.  It contains the Linux Kernel (4.11.5), the GNU C Library, and the core GNU/Linux programs.  The distribution was built following the guidelines of the [Linux From Scratch][1] project (version [8.0][2]).  

## Build

Build was completed on June 25, 2017.  All sources were compiled for *x86_64*.  The distribution is not guaranteed to perform in a production environment.  Please use at own risk.
